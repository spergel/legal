Scraper for Queens County Bar Association events: https://members.qcba.org/qcba-events-and-education-calendar

NOTE: This scraper currently finds 0 events because QCBA uses GrowthZone to dynamically load
events via JavaScript. The website shows events like:
- Meet the Judge Series
- CLE: AI and the Legal Profession  
- Golf, Tennis & Pickleball Outing

REQUIRES BROWSER AUTOMATION: Playwright or Selenium needed to wait for JavaScript content to load.
