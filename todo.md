## Scraper Development

### Scraper Status (as of 2025-06-28)

-   **Working ✅ (15)**:
    -   `aabany_rss` - 54 events
    -   `brooklynbar` - 5 events
    -   `chips_network` - 7 events
    -   `cuny_law_ics` - 5 events
    -   `fedbar_ics` - 26 events
    -   `fordham` - 92 events
    -   `hnba_ics` - 25 events
    -   `lgbtbarny` - 72 events
    -   `lsuite` - 16 events ✅ **NEWLY FIXED**
    -   `nawl` - 3 events
    -   `nyiac` - 1 event
    -   `nycbar` - 12 events
    -   `nysba` - 66 events
    -   `wbasny` - 12 events
-   **Needs Work 🟡 (5)** - All require browser automation:
    -   `lawyers_alliance`: Finding 0 events. HTML structure changed, no events in expected format.
    -   `lawline`: API returns empty response. Likely needs browser session for valid cookies.
    -   `acc`: Blocked by Auth0 login page. Requires browser automation.
    -   `barkergilmore`: Event content dynamically loaded via JavaScript.
    -   `qcba`: Event content dynamically loaded via JavaScript (GrowthZone platform). Website shows 3+ active events but requires browser automation.
    -   `cardozo_law`: Finds 5 "Bar Study Rooms" (room bookings), needs filtering for actual academic events.
    -   `brooklyn_law`: Dynamic content, currently shows no events but website structure suggests events exist.
    -   `nyls`: Uses EventON calendar plugin with AJAX loading, requires browser automation.
    -   `stjohns_law`: Uses TeamUp calendar system with JavaScript loading. Has law-specific categories ("Law Alumni Events", "School of Law") but requires browser automation.

### Scrapers Requiring Browser Automation 🌐

The following scrapers require a headless browser (like Playwright or Pyppeteer) to correctly render dynamic content or bypass anti-scraping measures.

-   **`acc_scraper`**: Blocked by an Auth0 login page.
-   **`barkergilmore_scraper`**: Although marked as blocked by authentication, the initial issue is that event content is not found in static HTML, suggesting it's dynamically loaded.
-   **`lawyers_alliance_scraper`**: Event data is loaded dynamically via JavaScript.
-   **`lawline_scraper`**: The target API returns an empty response, likely due to an expired session cookie that needs to be acquired through a browser session.
-   **`lsuite_scraper`**: ~~Event elements are not found by BeautifulSoup, indicating dynamic, JS-driven rendering.~~ ✅ **FIXED 2025-06-28** - Works with traditional scraping using proper selectors.
-   **`qcba_scraper`**: Event content is loaded dynamically via GrowthZone platform. Website shows active events (Meet the Judge Series, CLE programs, Golf Outing) but requires browser automation to access.

### Investigation Needed 🔍

-   **`barkergilmore_scraper` Import Error**: The production environment is reporting `cannot import name 'LgbtBarNyScraper' from 'scrapers.lgbtbarny_scraper.py'` when trying to import the `BarkerGilmoreScraper`. This import statement does not exist in the source file, suggesting a possible caching issue or a misconfigured file in the production environment.

### Recent Accomplishments
- [x] **Fixed `lsuite` Scraper (2025-06-28)**: Completed the previously "To Be Built" scraper, fixing duplicate event names and date parsing issues. Now successfully scrapes 16 events.
- [x] **Improved Import Handling**: Fixed relative import issues in the scraper runner for better script execution reliability.
- [x] **Updated Scraper Status**: Now have 14 working scrapers (up from 13) collecting 396 total events, achieving 74% success rate.
- [x] **Enabled All Scrapers**: Uncommented and tested all 15 available scrapers.
- [x] **Fixed Multiple Scraper Bugs**: Resolved `IndentationError` in `hnba_ics_scraper.py` and `nysba_scraper.py`, and an `AttributeError` in `lawyers_alliance_scraper.py`.

- [x] **Fixed `aabany_rss`**: Resolved a 403 error by adding headers and then fixed a parse error by finding the correct RSS feed URL.
- [x] **Improved Local Runner**: Added `--scrapers` flag to `run_all_scrapers_local.py` for targeted testing.
